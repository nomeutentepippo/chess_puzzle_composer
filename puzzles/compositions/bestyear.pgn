{To win White must promote his pawn, but his knight, which he can ill afford
to part with, is in peril, especially from Black's king.  It is not so simple.
} 1. b6+ Ka3 {Otherwise the knight emerges and White wins straightforwardly,
if necessary checkmating with bishop and knight against the lone  king, after
White's pawn has cost Black his rook.} (1... Ra2 2. b7 Kb5 3. Kb8 Rxa1 4. Kc8

{The 'AT' event was an anniversary tourney commemorating the 70 years since
the founding of the Pacific Ocean port of Magadan.  White can easily deal with
Black's threat to promote on g1, but Black also has threats to mobilise his
dark pawn phalanx, against which White has 'only' his advanced d-pawn. Can the
blocked pawn on a6 play a part?} 1. Kf2 f4 2. d7+ (2. hxg5 h4) 2... fxg3+ 3.
